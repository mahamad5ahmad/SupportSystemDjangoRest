# Support Ticket System API

> ⚠️ **Note on Asynchronous Support**

This project is currently built using **standard synchronous Django views and configuration**. As such, API requests are handled synchronously by default, which is sufficient for many use cases but will not scale optimally for high-concurrency scenarios.

To enable full **asynchronous (non-blocking) request handling**, the following changes are required:

1. **Run Django using an ASGI server**, such as `uvicorn` or `daphne`, instead of the default dev server.
2. **Convert views to asynchronous views**, using `async def` along with DRF's `APIView` or compatible async-compatible classes.
3. **Use `async`-compatible database drivers and ORM layers** (e.g., `databases` or `Tortoise ORM` if not using Django ORM).
4. **Write asynchronous tests** using libraries like `pytest-asyncio` or `httpx` instead of Django's default test client.
5. **Ensure middleware and third-party packages are compatible** with async execution.

> 📝 **Intentional Design Choice**:  
> Asynchronous support was not added at this stage **intentionally**, to maintain focus on core REST API principles and Django's standard stack. This decision is not due to limitations in knowledge or capability, and async implementation can be added as a future enhancement if required.
For now, the application is fully functional in a synchronous context.
